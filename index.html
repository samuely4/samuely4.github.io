                <h5>
                    The first case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed in New York City in March 2020 by a woman who had recently traveled to New York City from Iran,
                    a country seriously affected already by the COVID-19 pandemic at the time. Nearly a month later,
                    the metropolitan area was the worst-affected area in the country, with its medical infrastructure overtaxed.
                    By April, the city had more confirmed coronavirus cases than China, the U.K.,
                    or Iran, and by May, had more cases than any country other than the United States.
                    On March 20, the governor's office issued an executive order closing down non-essential businesses.
                    The city's public transportation system remained open but experienced crowding due to reduced transit service and an increase of homeless persons seeking shelter on the subway.
                    By April, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers were out of work with lost tax revenues estimated to run into the billions.
                    Low income jobs in the retail, transportation and restaurant sectors are especially affected.
                    The drop in income, sales tax and tourism revenues including hotel tax revenue may have cost the city up to $10 billion.
                    Mayor Bill de Blasio has said the city's unemployment system collapsed following a surge in claims and it will require federal assistance to maintain basic services.
                    The ongoing pandemic is the deadliest disaster by death toll in the history of New York City. The following is an interactive slideshow outlining the most difficult 4 months
                    (March, April, May, June) of 2020 during which New Yorkers fought the virus bravely.

This was also the first known case of an animal contracting the disease from human contact in the US. On April 22 it was reported that four additional tigers plus three lions had tested positive.

Due to the crisis circumstances of the pandemic, the real death toll was unknown. Bodies of those who had died at home, around 280 per day, were being picked up by the US Army, National Guard, and Air National Guard. As of April 8, at least 80 % of New York City virus patients put on ventilators had died.

As of April 8, these communities, with a cumulative 600,000 residents, had recorded 7,260 COVID-19 cases.

A survey conducted May 5-12 and reported in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report found that 42% of 286 respondents residing in the New York City metropolitan area knew someone who had tested positive for COVID-19, and 23.1% knew someone who had died. These figures were considerably higher than those reported by respondents from Los Angeles(10.8% and 7.3%, respectively) and from across the United States (16.8% and 5.9%, respectively). During May, COVID-19 cases started to decline. After the George Floyd protests in New York City started in late May, public officials expressed concern about the spread of COVID-19 via the crowded events.
