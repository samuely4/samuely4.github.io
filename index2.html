The virus then grew exponentially: by March 25, over 17,800 cases had been confirmed in New York City, with 199 deaths. At the time, the city's infection rate was five times higher than the rest of the country, and its cases and were one-third of total confirmed US cases. The reasons for the high infection rate continue to be discussed. On March 27, infection in New York City surpassed 23,000, with 365 deaths. Queens was the worst-affected borough by number of deaths, with over a third of total deaths; the majority of the deceased had underlying health issues. Between March 28 and 29, the number of deaths in New York City tripled from the previous 24-hour period; 222 people died of the virus bringing the city's fatalities to 672, with 30,765 confirmed cases.

Refrigerator trucks were set up on city streets outside hospitals to accommodate the overflow of bodies of the deceased.

As of April 4, there were 1,200 medical military personnel serving on the USNS Comfort. 2,700 New York State National Guardforces had also been deployed. On April 5, it was reported that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo had contracted COVID-19, the first known case of a tiger anywhere being infected with the disease. Several other 'big cats' were found to have COVID-19, the first of which had started showing symptoms on March 27; they were believed to have contracted COVID-19 from an infected zookeeper who was not yet showing symptoms. This was also the first known case of an animal contracting the disease from human contact in the US. On April 22 it was reported that four additional tigers plus three lions had tested positive. On April 6 there were 72,181 confirmed cases, with at least 2,475 deaths. NYC accounted for 25% of COVID-19 deaths in the United States.

Due to the crisis circumstances of the pandemic, the real death toll was unknown. Bodies of those who had died at home, around 280 per day, were being picked up by the US Army, National Guard, and Air National Guard. As of April 8, at least 80 % of New York City virus patients put on ventilators had died. Some of the communities most affected by the pandemic included densely-populated neighborhoods in north-central Queens with high immigrant populations, including Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights. As of April 8, these communities, with a cumulative 600,000 residents, had recorded 7,260 COVID-19 cases.
